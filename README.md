## Language Used

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Node.js.

The assignment was to make all the buttons functional and understand that passport is used to create and use log ins for users. The users and message board posts are stored in MongoDB. I used bootstrap to style the site. 

## Lesson Learned

I learned how each page connects to each other on the server side. This was also my first experience with a web application with an authorization feature.
