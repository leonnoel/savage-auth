# Savage Fan Site - Full Stack Application

This is a full stack social media inspired site. It includes a login authentification, sign up page, and ways for users to post messages, like and dislike, delete messages, and see what other users have posted.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Node.js, EJS

This is the first full stack application with login that we've created. Looking through the structure of the application and how it works has helped me learn to create similar apps for the future.

## Lessons Learned:

I'll continue to see how apps like this work and the structure of it. I am getting a little more comfortable using EJS to update and manipulate the DOM.
