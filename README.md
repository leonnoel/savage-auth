<b>Tech Used:</b> ExpressJS, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.JS, Passport and MongoDB

<b>What I Learned</b>: My first full stack app! It's amazing to be able to use authorization. This is the first project where I incorporated it and it really adds a different feel to the app. It makes it look and feel more complete. It was also challenging to style all the different ejs files with the same style sheet. A lot of class names were utilized and overall I do like how I was able to manipulate the look of the page.
